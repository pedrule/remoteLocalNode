# HowTo: Components

![Travis CI Build status badge](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/howto-components.svg?branch=master)

“HowTo: Components” is [a subsection on Web Fundamentals Architecture section](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/examples/), containing a collection of web components that implement common web UI patterns using modern web technologies like Custom Elements v1 and ESnext with a special focus on accessibility, performance and progressive enhancement. Their purpose is to be an educational resource. Users are supposed to read and learn from their implementations. They are explicitly **NOT** a UI library meant to be used in production.

## Demos

You can run the demos locally, after you build them:

```
npm install  # if you haven't already
npm run build
python -m SimpleHTTPServer  # or your favourite local server
```

In your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` (or the port that you're running the local server from.)

You can also run

```
npm run watch
```

to continuously run the build whenever a file changes.

### WebFundamentals

To generate the content for [WebFundamentals](https://github.com/Google/WebFundamentals), run the `build-webfundamentals.sh` script. It will create a `webfundamentals` folder. The contents needs to be moved into the WebFundamentals repository. If new components have been created, they need to be added manually to [WebFundamentals Web Components table of contents](https://github.com/google/WebFundamentals/blob/master/src/content/en/fundamentals/web-components/_toc.yaml).

## Testing

Tests are written using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/). Each component has tests.

### Local

Tests run using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/browsers.html). Run the tests with

```
$ npm test
```

This assumes that Chrome, Firefox and Safari are installed as the tests run in all of these browser (using the [Custom Elements v1 Polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements)).

### Local + Docker (or Travis)

Tests can also run in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container (as we do on Travis):

```
$ npm run docker
```

This builds a docker image `googlechrome/howto-components` and runs it. The dockerized tests use Chrome only.

## Staging

All branches and PRs are built and uploaded on Travis CI. The staged version can be viewed at `http://dash-elements.surma.link/<commit hash>`.
